- **cleaned_weather_data.csv**: The processed dataset with missing values handled and correct formatting.
- **Project_Report.md**: A detailed summary of the statistical findings.
- **Images:**
  - `plot_temperature_trend.png`: Line chart of daily temperatures.
  - `plot_humidity_vs_temp.png`: Scatter plot of humidity vs temperature.
  - `plot_combined.png`: Multi-panel view of temperature and rainfall.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data frame manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical and statistical calculations.
- **Matplotlib**: For generating data visualizations.
